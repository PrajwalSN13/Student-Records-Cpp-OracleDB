# Student Records Management System (C++ + Oracle DB)

A simple CRUD application built with **C++** and **Oracle Database**, where users can add, update, delete, and view student details.  
The project demonstrates **C++ database connectivity** and relational schema design for persistent data storage.

---

## Features
- Add, update, delete, and view student records.  
- Persistent storage using Oracle Database.  
- Menu-driven C++ program for user interaction.  

---

## Implementation
- **Application Layer (C++)**: Handles the menu, user input, and logic for CRUD operations.  
- **Database Layer (Oracle DB)**: Stores student information in relational tables.  
- **Integration**: Uses Oracle database connectors (ODBC/OCI) to run SQL queries from C++.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation.  
- `main.cpp` – Application source code (C++).  
- `database.sql` – Schema definition for the Oracle DB.  
- `config.json` – Database connection settings (no real credentials if public).  
- `docs/` – Optional reports, design docs, or screenshots.

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on practice with **C++ and Oracle DB integration**.  
- Exposure to **database schema design and CRUD operations**.  
- Understanding of how enterprise systems connect applications with databases.
